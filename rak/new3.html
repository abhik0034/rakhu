        <p>She was beautiful, but not like those girls in the magazines.</p>
        <p>She was beautiful, for the way she thought.</p>
        <p>She was beautiful, for the sparkle in her eyes when she talked about something she loved.</p>
        <p>She was beautiful, for her ability to make other people smile, even if she was sad.</p>
        <p>No, she wasn't beautiful for something as temporary as her looks.</p>
        <p>She was beautiful, deep down to her soul.</p>
